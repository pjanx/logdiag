<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This document will guide you through the application and help to familiarize
you with it. The description of tasks mainly targets the Microsoft Windows
operating system, though it’s also valid for other operating systems to
a certain extent.

<h2>Getting the application</h2>
<p>Download the newest version of the application at the following web address:
<a href="https://git.janouch.name/p/logdiag">https://git.janouch.name/p/logdiag</a>.

<br>Figure 1: The download menu on the project site

<p>While on the web, look for a tab entitled <q>Releases</q> and click on it.
A list of versions will appear with files for download listed under
<q>Downloads</q> headings.  The installation file for Microsoft Windows is named
in the style of <q>logdiag-<i>version</i>-Windows-x86.exe</q>.

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The installation process is quite straight-forward. After the initial screen
a license agreement is required. Next, choose a folder in which to install
the application and another one for placement in the Start menu. So long as
no unexpected errors have occurred, all that’s left is confirming a successful
installation.

<p><b>Warning</b>: If the application is installed into a folder where
a previous installation is already located, problems may arise. Although it is
possible to do so, don’t try to install multiple copies parallely either, for
the same reasons. Remove the current installation first, for example by using
the shortcut located in the Start menu.

<h2>Operations with objects</h2>
<p>Each diagram consists of objects, and these are accompanied by the operations
described below. To cancel any current operation, press the Escape key.

<!-- TODO: see the Czech version -->

<h3>Selecting objects</h3>
<p>Select single objects by left-clicking on them. They will get highlighted
with red color in reaction to this. To select multiple objects, hold the Shift
key while clicking.

<br>Figure 2: Selecting objects inside an area

<p>Alternatively drag the mouse from free space within the diagram into
the area, see <a href="#select-objects">Figure 2</a>. Objects contained in this
rectangle will be selected. The selection may later be dismissed by just
clicking into free space.

<h3>Moving objects</h3>
<p>Moving of objects is done by dragging them with the mouse onto the desired
place. If these objects form a part of the current selection, the whole
selection is moved. The selection may also be moved using cursor keys.

<h3>Removing objects</h3>
<p>Remove objects either by pressing the Delete key or from the application
menu.

<h3>Inserting symbols</h3>
<p><i>Symbols</i> constitute the most important kind of objects. Insert them
into the diagram by choosing one from the symbol menu located on the left side
of the main application window and dragging it onto the diagram where you want
the symbol to be placed.

<h3>Rotating symbols</h3>
<p>Rotate a symbol inserted into the diagram by right-clicking on it.

<h3>Connecting terminals</h3>
<p>A point intended for creation of connections between symbols or other
connections is called a <i>terminal</i>. To lead a connection out of it, first
hover it with the mouse pointer, so it gets visibly highlighted with a circle.
Then press the left mouse button and drag the pointer onto the place where you
want the connection to end.

<h2>Frequent problems</h2>
<h3>Can’t open a saved diagram</h3>
<p>When saving, ensure that the filename you’ve typed in contains the
<q>.ldd</q> suffix. If not, it won’t show up in the dialog for opening diagrams.
In case you’ve already saved a file without an extension, you may fix this
situation by adding the suffix to its name.

<h3>How do I print a diagram?</h3>
<p>The current version of application is not able to print directly. To print
out a created diagram, you may use the PrintScreen key to capture a screenshot,
then insert it to, for example, Paint, and print it from inside the graphics
editor.

<h3>I miss labels</h3>
<p>Similarly to the previous case, this functionality doesn’t exist yet, but it
is possible to get around this limitation using a graphics editor.

<script>
var toc = '', all = document.querySelectorAll('h2')
for (var i = 0; i < all.length; i++) {
	var name = all[i].innerHTML.replace(/[^0-9a-z]/ig, '-')
	toc += '<li><p><a href="#' + name + '">' + all[i].innerHTML + '</a></li>'
	all[i].id = name
	all[i].innerHTML = (i + 1) + '. ' + all[i].innerHTML
}
all[0].insertAdjacentHTML('beforebegin',
	'<h2>Table of Contents</h2><ol>' + toc + '</ol>')
</script>

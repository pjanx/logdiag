Introduction
------------
This document will guide you through the application and help to familiarize you
with it. The description of tasks mainly targets the Microsoft Windows
operating system, though it's also valid for other operating systems to
a certain extent.

Getting the application
-----------------------
Download the newest version of the application at the following web address:
https://git.janouch.name/p/logdiag.

[[gitea-download]]
.The download menu on the project site

While on the web, look for a tab entitled ``Releases'' and click on it. A list
of versions will appear with files for download listed under ``Downloads''
headings.  The installation file for Microsoft Windows is named in the style of
``logdiag-__version__-Windows-x86.exe''.

Installation
------------
The installation process is quite straight-forward. After the initial screen a
license agreement is required. Next, choose a folder in which to install the
application and another one for placement in the Start menu. So long as no
unexpected errors have occurred, all that's left is confirming a successful
installation.

WARNING: If the application is installed into a folder where a previous
installation is already located, problems may arise. Although it is possible to
do so, don't try to install multiple copies parallely either, for the same
reasons. Remove the current installation first, for example by using the
shortcut located in the Start menu.

Each diagram consists of objects, and these are accompanied by the operations
described below. To cancel any current operation, press the Escape key.

Selecting objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Select single objects by left-clicking on them. They will get highlighted with
red color in reaction to this. To select multiple objects, hold the Shift key
while clicking.

[[select-objects]]
.Selecting objects inside an area

Alternatively drag the mouse from free space within the diagram into the area,
see <<select-objects>>. Objects contained in this rectangle will be
selected. The selection may later be dismissed by just clicking into free space.

Moving objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Moving of objects is done by dragging them with the mouse onto the desired
place. If these objects form a part of the current selection, the whole
selection is moved. The selection may also be moved using cursor keys.

Removing objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Remove objects either by pressing the Delete key or from the application menu.

Inserting symbols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
_Symbols_ constitute the most important kind of objects. Insert them into the
diagram by choosing one from the symbol menu located on the left side of the
main application window, see <<select-symbol>>, and dragging it onto the diagram
where you want the symbol to be placed.

Rotating symbols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rotate a symbol inserted into the diagram by right-clicking on it.

Connecting terminals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A point intended for creation of connections between symbols or other
connections is called a _terminal_. To lead a connection out of it, first
hover it with the mouse pointer, so it gets visibly highlighted with a circle.
Then press the left mouse button and drag the pointer onto the place where you
want the connection to end.

Frequent problems
-----------------

Can't open a saved diagram
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When saving, ensure that the filename you've typed in contains the ``.ldd''
suffix. If not, it won't show up in the dialog for opening diagrams. In case
you've already saved a file without an extension, you may fix this situation by
adding the suffix to its name.

How do I print a diagram?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The current version of application is not able to print directly. To print out a
created diagram, you may use the PrintScreen key to capture a screenshot, then
insert it to, for example, Paint, and print it from inside the graphics editor.

I miss labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Similarly to the previous case, this functionality doesn't exist yet, but it is
possible to get around this limitation using a graphics editor.
